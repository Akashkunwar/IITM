Based on the my observation, I understand the following key aspects that require attention:

1. Images: High-quality PNG logos and additional images for various sections of the website are required.

2. Timeframe: The website appears to have only a theme template, and numerous pages need to be created from scratch. Given the improvements needed across more than 20 pages which can be seen in footers that is mission, this will be a time-consuming task. Achieving a comprehensive, fully functional, and visually appealing website will take an estimated 3-4 weeks, considering the upcoming festivals. Given the extensive work involved, an hourly payment structure might not be feasible, and milestones could be more suitable for this project's progress tracking and payments.

3. Layout Enhancement: Improvements are required in several areas, such as the "How It Works" section, headers, footers, and the FAQ section to ensure a more polished appearance and functionality across devices.

4. Repetitive Content: The "How It Works" section appears redundant, located both in the middle and at the top. We'll need to discuss whether both sections need to be retained or if modifications are required.

5. Complete Overhaul: It seems that only a template is in place, and multiple pages need creation from scratch. This includes adding pages, adjusting the header and footer, and ensuring responsive design for various devices.

6. Content and Credentials: Clarification is needed regarding the specific pages requiring content and credentials.

Considering the intricate work required for theme adjustments, design enhancements, overall layout improvements, page additions, header/footer modifications, responsiveness checks, and content experiments, I propose a comprehensive timeline for completion. As mentioned, due to the upcoming festival season and the extensive work involved, a milestone-based approach seems more suitable to ensure a thorough and satisfactory outcome.

I'll be available for further discussions to clarify any additional details and commence work once the terms and timeline are mutually agreed upon.
